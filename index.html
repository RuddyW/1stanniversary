        Hey Theodora,
        <br>
        Since the day we met in May 2024, I haven’t stopped thinking about how special you are. We officially became us on July 25th, and from that moment on, every day has felt brighter, fuller, and more meaningful just because you’re in my life.
        <br>
        I love your personality, the way you’re so creative, so fun, so cute, and yes, beautifully overthinking everything in your own adorable way. You’re goal-driven and passionate, and that fire in you inspires me to be better every day. Honestly, just the thought of you puts the biggest smile on my face.
        <br>
        I’m proud to be your gentle giant, the one who’s here for you. We’ve had our ups and downs, moments when life tested us, but through it all, we’ve stayed inseparable. And that, to me, means everything. The memories we’ve made together already feel like a lifetime, and I treasure each one.
        <br>
        I’ll never forget making you walk those 20 kilometers, and in that moment, I realized you’d do anything with me, no matter what. It showed me the strength of your heart and the trust we share. There are so many more adventures waiting for us, and I’m excited to face them all with you by my side.
        <br>
        Thank you for being you — creative, fun, beautiful, driven, and for loving me the way you do. I’m looking forward to celebrating many more years, many more memories, and so much more love with you.
        <br><br>Always yours,
        <br>Ruddy
